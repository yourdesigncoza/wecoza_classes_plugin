# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the inability to edit existing QA visit entries in the class update form. Currently, while QA visit data (dates, types, officers, reports) is being saved successfully to the database, when users attempt to edit an existing class, the saved QA visit entries are not properly populated into the editable form fields within the #qa-visits-container. This prevents users from modifying or updating existing QA visit information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a class administrator, I want to edit existing QA visit entries when updating a class, so that I can modify visit dates, types, officers, and reports as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the class update form for a class with existing QA visit data THEN the system SHALL populate all saved QA visit entries into editable form rows
2. WHEN QA visit data exists in the format qa_visit_dates[], qa_visit_types[], qa_officers[], qa_reports[] THEN the system SHALL create corresponding form rows with pre-filled values
3. WHEN I modify any QA visit field (date, type, officer, report) THEN the system SHALL allow me to save the updated information
4. WHEN I submit the form with modified QA visit data THEN the system SHALL update the database with the new values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a class administrator, I want to add new QA visit entries to existing classes, so that I can record additional visits that occur after the initial class creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the class update form THEN the system SHALL display existing QA visit entries AND allow me to add new ones
2. WHEN I click "Add QA Visit Date" THEN the system SHALL create a new empty row for additional QA visit data
3. WHEN I have both existing and new QA visit entries THEN the system SHALL save all entries correctly without data loss

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a class administrator, I want to remove existing QA visit entries, so that I can correct mistakes or remove visits that were recorded in error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view existing QA visit entries THEN each entry SHALL have a "Remove" button
2. WHEN I click the "Remove" button on an existing QA visit entry THEN the system SHALL remove that entry from the form
3. WHEN I submit the form after removing QA visit entries THEN the system SHALL update the database to reflect the removal
4. WHEN there is only one QA visit entry THEN the system SHALL prevent removal to maintain at least one entry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a class administrator, I want the QA visits form to handle data format consistency, so that the editing functionality works regardless of how the data was originally stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN QA visit data exists in different formats (array vs string) THEN the system SHALL normalize the data for consistent editing
2. WHEN QA visit arrays have different lengths THEN the system SHALL handle missing values gracefully
3. WHEN QA visit data contains empty or null values THEN the system SHALL skip those entries during population
4. WHEN the form loads with existing data THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before population
