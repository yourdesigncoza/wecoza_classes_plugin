   - Add qa_officers table for officer profiles and specializations
   - Implement qa_assignments table for tracking assignments
   - Create qa_metrics table for analytics data storage
   - Add appropriate indexes for performance

5. API Endpoints:
   - GET /api/qa/visits/{class_id} - Retrieve visit history
   - POST /api/qa/visits - Create new visit record
   - GET /api/qa/analytics - Fetch dashboard data
   - POST /api/qa/assign - Create officer assignment
   - PUT /api/qa/assign/{id} - Update assignment
   - GET /api/qa/officers/availability - Check officer schedules

6. Integration Points:
   - Modify classes-display.view.php to include QA summary strips
   - Update single-class-display.view.php with detailed QA sections
   - Add QA dashboard to main admin area
   - Integrate with existing notification system
   - Connect to user roles and permissions system

# Test Strategy:

   - Ensure responsive design on mobile devices
   - Test with classes having 0, 1, and multiple visits

2. Analytics Dashboard Testing:
   - Verify all charts render with correct data
   - Test date range filters and data refresh
   - Validate export functionality produces accurate reports
   - Test dashboard performance with large datasets
   - Ensure calculations for averages and trends are accurate

3. Officer Assignment Testing:
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality across browsers
   - Verify assignment algorithm produces logical suggestions
   - Test conflict detection with overlapping schedules
   - Validate notification delivery to assigned officers
   - Test bulk assignment with various selection criteria

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify data flows correctly between all components
   - Test user permissions for different roles
   - Ensure existing functionality remains unaffected
   - Validate API endpoints with various payloads
   - Test error handling and edge cases

5. Performance Testing:
   - Load test with 1000+ visits and 50+ officers
   - Verify page load times remain under 3 seconds
