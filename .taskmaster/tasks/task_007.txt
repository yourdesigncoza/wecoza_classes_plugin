# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhanced Notes System for Class Notes & QA Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a dynamic notes interface with timeline view, advanced filtering, and search functionality integrated into the update-class.php page for improved class notes and Q&A management
# Details:
1. Dynamic Notes Interface:
   - Create responsive React/Vue component or vanilla JS module for notes display
   - Implement card-based layout with expandable/collapsible note sections
   - Add rich text editor integration (TinyMCE/Quill) for note creation and editing
   - Enable inline editing capabilities with auto-save functionality
   - Implement drag-and-drop for note reorganization
   - Add note categorization with color-coding and tags

2. Timeline View Implementation:
   - Design chronological timeline component showing notes and Q&A entries
   - Create visual timeline with date markers and connecting lines
   - Implement zoom controls for different time scales (day/week/month/year)
   - Add timeline navigation with smooth scrolling to specific dates
   - Include activity indicators showing note creation/modification times
   - Integrate Q&A threads into timeline with visual distinction

3. Advanced Filtering System:
   - Build multi-criteria filter panel with collapsible sections
   - Implement filters for: date range, note type, author, tags, keywords
   - Create filter presets for common searches (e.g., 'My Notes', 'This Week')
   - Add real-time filter application with smooth animations
   - Implement filter persistence using localStorage
   - Create filter combination logic with AND/OR operators

4. Search Functionality:
   - Implement full-text search with highlighting of matched terms
   - Add search suggestions and auto-complete based on existing content
   - Create advanced search with field-specific queries
   - Implement search result ranking based on relevance
   - Add search history and saved searches feature
   - Include fuzzy search for typo tolerance

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large note collections
   - Add lazy loading for notes outside viewport
   - Create efficient indexing for search operations
   - Implement debouncing for search and filter inputs
   - Add caching layer for frequently accessed data

6. Integration with update-class.php:
   - Modify existing PHP template to accommodate new interface
   - Create REST API endpoints for notes CRUD operations
   - Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing WordPress user roles
   - Add proper nonce verification for all AJAX requests

# Test Strategy:
1. Interface Testing:
   - Verify all UI components render correctly across browsers
   - Test responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Ensure smooth animations and transitions
   - Validate drag-and-drop functionality across different scenarios
   - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility features

2. Timeline View Testing:
   - Verify correct chronological ordering of entries
   - Test zoom functionality at all scale levels
   - Ensure smooth scrolling and navigation
   - Validate date calculations and display formatting
   - Test performance with large datasets (1000+ entries)

3. Filter Testing:
   - Test each filter type individually and in combinations
   - Verify filter persistence across page reloads
   - Ensure correct result counts after filtering
   - Test edge cases (empty results, invalid date ranges)
   - Validate filter performance with complex queries

4. Search Testing:
   - Test search accuracy with various query types
   - Verify highlighting works correctly in all contexts
   - Test search performance with large datasets
   - Validate auto-complete suggestions
   - Test special character handling and escaping

5. Integration Testing:
   - Verify all AJAX endpoints return expected data
   - Test concurrent user scenarios
   - Validate proper error handling and user feedback
   - Ensure no conflicts with existing WordPress functionality
   - Test data integrity during CRUD operations

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure page load times with varying data volumes
   - Test memory usage during extended sessions
   - Verify no memory leaks in JavaScript components
   - Benchmark search and filter response times
   - Test under high concurrent user load
