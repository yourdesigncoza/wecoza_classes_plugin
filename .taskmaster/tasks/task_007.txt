# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhanced Notes System for Class Notes & QA Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a simplified notes interface with basic filtering and search functionality integrated into the update-class.php page for improved class notes and Q&A management using pure PHP and jQuery
# Details:
1. Simple Notes Interface (Pure PHP):
   - Create basic card or table layout for notes display using PHP templates
   - Simple note creation and editing with textarea inputs rendered by PHP
   - Basic note categorization with simple tags using PHP arrays
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop with CSS

2. Basic Display Implementation (PHP-based):
   - Simple chronological list/table showing notes and Q&A entries using PHP loops
   - Basic date sorting (newest/oldest first) with PHP usort()
   - Simple pagination for large note collections using PHP offset/limit

3. Basic Filtering System (PHP + jQuery):
   - Simple filter options for: date range, note type, and class
   - Basic dropdown/select inputs for filter controls rendered by PHP
   - Real-time filter application using jQuery AJAX calls to PHP endpoints
   - Filter state persistence using localStorage in jQuery

4. jQuery Search Functionality:
   - Basic full-text search with jQuery making AJAX calls to PHP search endpoint
   - Simple search highlighting of matched terms using jQuery
   - Search input with basic debouncing using jQuery
   - Clear search functionality with jQuery event handlers

5. Performance Optimization (PHP-focused):
   - Use WordPress transients for caching frequently accessed data in PHP
   - Basic pagination to limit initial load using PHP LIMIT queries
   - Simple debouncing for search inputs using jQuery setTimeout

6. Integration with update-class.php (Pure PHP):
   - Modify existing PHP template for new interface without any JavaScript frameworks
   - Create basic AJAX endpoints using WordPress admin-ajax.php for notes CRUD operations
   - Standard WordPress AJAX handling with nonce verification in PHP
   - Integration assumes page access controls handle user permissions

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing only:

1. Interface Testing:
   - Manually verify PHP-rendered UI components display correctly in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Test responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
   - Verify basic functionality across different screen sizes
   - Ensure no JavaScript framework dependencies are present

2. Filter Testing:
   - Manually test each filter type (date, note type, class) via jQuery AJAX to PHP
   - Test filter combinations
   - Verify filter persistence after page reload using localStorage
   - Test with various data sets processed by PHP

3. Search Testing:
   - Test search with different keywords and phrases sent to PHP endpoint
   - Verify search highlighting works correctly with jQuery
   - Test search with empty results from PHP
   - Test search clearing functionality

4. Integration Testing:
   - Manually verify WordPress AJAX endpoints work correctly
   - Test note creation, editing, and deletion through PHP processing
   - Verify proper error handling and user feedback
   - Test caching behavior with WordPress transients

5. Basic Performance Testing:
   - Manually test with varying amounts of note data processed by PHP
   - Verify page responsiveness during search and filtering
   - Test pagination functionality with large datasets using PHP queries

6. Technology Stack Verification:
   - Confirm no React, Vue, or other JavaScript frameworks are used
   - Verify all templating is done with pure PHP
   - Ensure jQuery is only used for DOM manipulation and AJAX calls
