			"taskTitle": "Enhanced Notes System for Class Notes & QA Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Enhanced Notes System implementation into specific subtasks focusing on: 1) PHP template creation for notes interface, 2) Basic display and sorting implementation, 3) Filter system with PHP backend and jQuery AJAX, 4) Search functionality with jQuery and PHP endpoints, 5) Integration with update-class.php and performance optimization. Each subtask should detail the pure PHP/jQuery implementation without any JavaScript frameworks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves moderate complexity with clear technical requirements. It requires building a complete notes management system using traditional web technologies (PHP/jQuery) integrated into WordPress. The 5 existing subtasks appropriately cover the main components: interface, display/sorting, filtering, search, and integration. The complexity stems from the need to build interactive features without modern frameworks while maintaining performance."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "QA Integration and Advanced Features Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the QA Integration task into subtasks covering: 1) Database schema design and migration for QA tables, 2) QA visit summary strips UI component development, 3) Analytics dashboard with Chart.js implementation, 4) Officer assignment system with scheduling logic, 5) API endpoint development for all QA operations, 6) Integration with existing class display pages. Focus on modular development that can be tested independently.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex task requiring multiple integrated components including database design, UI development, analytics visualization, scheduling algorithms, and API development. The task involves creating an entire QA management subsystem with visual dashboards, assignment logic, and multiple integration points. The recommended 6 subtasks would allow proper separation of concerns between data layer, business logic, UI components, and integration work."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Future Requirements Documentation - Mobile UX, Offline Capabilities, and Advanced Features",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the documentation task into focused subtasks: 1) Mobile UX patterns and responsive design documentation, 2) Offline capabilities and PWA architecture specification, 3) Photo capture and media handling documentation, 4) GPS location services integration specification, 5) Real-time collaboration architecture documentation, 6) Export functionality and reporting system design. Each subtask should produce a complete specification document with wireframes, technical requirements, and implementation guidelines.",
			"reasoning": "While this is primarily a documentation task with lower implementation complexity, it requires comprehensive planning across multiple advanced features. The task covers 6 distinct feature areas that each need detailed specification. Breaking it into 6 subtasks allows focused documentation for each feature area while maintaining consistency across the overall system design. The complexity is moderate due to the need for technical research and architectural planning."
