- Build parent-specific dashboard views
- Add notification preference management

## Integration Strategy

### Implementation Approach
**4-Phase Incremental Development:**
1. **Minimal Viable Analytics (Weeks 1-3):** Basic progress tracking without disrupting existing functionality
2. **Core Dashboard Functionality (Weeks 4-6):** Full analytics dashboard with visualizations
3. **Automated Reporting System (Weeks 7-9):** Automated report generation and email notifications
4. **Parent Portal & Advanced Features (Weeks 10-12):** Complete stakeholder access and advanced analytics

### Testing & Validation
**Integration Testing:**
- WordPress Core Integration Tests (user roles, database operations, admin interface)
- WeCoza Classes Plugin Integration Tests (class data, student enrollment, attendance recording)
- Performance Testing (concurrent access, large datasets, report generation load)
- Security Testing (authentication, data access permissions, input validation)

**Compatibility Strategy:**
- **Backward Compatibility:** All existing WeCoza functionality preserved
- **WordPress Version Support:** Minimum WordPress 5.0 maintained
- **Theme Compatibility:** CSS isolation prevents conflicts
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Provides hooks for third-party integration

## Quality Standards & Best Practices

### Code Quality Requirements
**DRY Principle Compliance:**
- Shared Repository Base Class eliminates database query duplication
- Analytics Configuration Manager centralizes configuration logic
- Permission Management System consolidates access control
- Chart Data Formatter Utility reduces visualization duplication

**SOLID Principles:**
- Single Responsibility: Each component has clear, focused purpose
- Open/Closed: New chart types and metrics easily added without modification
- Liskov Substitution: All repositories and chart renderers interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Focused interfaces for specific purposes
- Dependency Inversion: Components depend on interfaces, not implementations

### Refactoring & Optimization
**Shared Utilities Created:**
- `Analytics_Config_Manager` - Centralized configuration management
- `Analytics_Cache_Manager` - Caching layer for performance optimization
- `Chart_Data_Formatter` - Reusable chart data transformation logic
- `Analytics_Permission_Manager` - Centralized access control
- `Progress_Data_Validator` - Shared validation and sanitization

**Performance Targets:**
- Database Query Limit: ≤ 5 queries per dashboard page load
- Chart Rendering Time: ≤ 2 seconds for complex visualizations
- Memory Usage: ≤ 128MB for analytics processing
- Code Duplication: ≤ 5% across all analytics components
