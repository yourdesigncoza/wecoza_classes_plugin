## Feature Request
"Add a comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens, role-based access control, password reset functionality, and integration with existing WordPress user system."

## Expected Agent Outputs

### Agent 1: Requirements Analysis
Should produce:
- Feature scope and complexity assessment
- Impact on existing WordPress authentication
- Dependencies on JWT libraries and WordPress hooks
- Security considerations and compliance requirements
- Performance implications for user login/logout
- Integration points with existing user management

### Agent 2: Architecture Planning  
Should produce:
- Component architecture for auth system
- File structure for auth modules
- Interface definitions for auth services
- JWT token management strategy
- Role-based access control design

- Migration strategy for current user data
- Error handling for auth failures
- Session management approach
- API endpoints for auth operations

### Agent 4: Quality Review
Should produce:
- DRY principle compliance check
- Security best practices review
- Code reusability opportunities
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Maintenance and documentation requirements

## Sample Test Commands

```bash
# Start test planning session
/planning-agent "Add comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens and role-based access control"

# Check session progress
/planning-session-manager status [SESSION_ID]

# Review agent outputs
/planning-approval review .taskmaster/docs/planning/sessions/[SESSION_ID]/requirements-analysis.md

# Approve agent work
/planning-approval approve [SESSION_ID] 1

# Finalize and integrate
/planning-finalize [SESSION_ID]

# Verify Task Master AI integration
