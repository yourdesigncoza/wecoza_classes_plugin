# Level/Module Data Persistence Fix

## Problem Statement
The level/module data in the class management system has the following issues:
1. Data loads correctly in the class learners section (shows "RLN")
2. Data is NOT being saved to the database
3. Exam learners section shows "Select Level" instead of populated data
4. Update script has the same population issue

## Components Affected
- #class-learners-container: Shows populated data but doesn't save
- #exam-learners-list: Shows "Select Level" instead of auto-populated data

## Files Involved
- app/Views/components/class-capture-partials/create-class.php
- app/Views/components/class-capture-partials/update-class.php  
- assets/js/class-schedule-form.js

## Requirements
1. Fix database save functionality for level/module data in class learners section
2. Auto-populate level/module data in exam learners section 
3. Ensure update script correctly populates and saves level/module data
4. Maintain data consistency between class learners and exam learners sections
5. Test all functionality to ensure data persistence works correctly

## Success Criteria
- Level/module data is saved to database when creating/updating classes
- Exam learners section auto-populates with correct level/module data
- Update forms correctly display and save existing level/module data
- Data consistency maintained across all sections
