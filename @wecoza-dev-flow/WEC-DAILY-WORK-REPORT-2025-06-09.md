**Date:** 2025-06-09  
**Developer:** John  
**Project:** WeCoza Classes Plugin – Class Schedule Rework  
**Title:** WEC-DAILY-WORK-REPORT-2025-06-09

## Executive Summary
Successfully implemented per-day time controls for the class schedule form, resolving display issues and adding comprehensive debugging functionality.

## 1. Git Commits (2025-06-09)
- c8278e3  **chore: auto-commit before end-of-day report**  (John)

## 2. Detailed Changes

- **c8278e3  chore: auto-commit before end-of-day report**  
  • Added comprehensive per-day time controls functionality to class schedule form
  • Implemented conditional display logic for single vs. multi-day schedules
  • Fixed JavaScript caching issues by implementing datetime-based versioning
  • Added debugging console logs for troubleshooting form behavior
  • Created task management documentation for WEC-101 project
  • Updated .gitignore to exclude development files
  • Modified create-class.php template with per-day time control sections
  • Enhanced class-schedule-form.js with updatePerDayTimeControls() function

## 3. Quality Assurance / Testing
- ✅ Verified per-day time controls display correctly when multiple days are selected
- ✅ Confirmed single-day schedule still shows unified time controls
- ✅ Tested "Copy to all days" functionality works as expected
- ✅ Validated JavaScript event handlers attach properly with event delegation
- ✅ Confirmed cache-busting versioning resolves file update issues

## 4. Next Steps
- [ ] Remove debugging console.log statements for production readiness (Task 2.6)
- [ ] Implement time validation for per-day inputs (start < end, no overlaps)
- [ ] Update backend data processing to handle new per-day schedule format
- [ ] Modify calendar integration to display per-day time events
- [ ] Add comprehensive styling for per-day time controls

## 5. Blockers / Notes
- **Resolved:** JavaScript caching issue was preventing updated code from loading - fixed with datetime versioning
- **Note:** Per-day time controls are now fully functional and ready for further development
- **Technical Debt:** Debugging console logs need cleanup before production deployment
