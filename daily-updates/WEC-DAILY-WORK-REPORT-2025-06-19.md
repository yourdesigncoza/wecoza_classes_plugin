## 2. Detailed Changes

### Major Feature Implementation (`f2055f8`)

> **Scope:** 136 insertions, 82 deletions across 3 files

#### **Form Layout Standardization**

*Updated `app/Views/components/class-capture-partials/update-class.php` (125 lines changed)*

* **Bootstrap Form Layout Conversion**: Migrated from floating label layout to standard Bootstrap form structure
* **Label Positioning**: Moved all form labels above inputs using `form-label` class with `mb-3` spacing
* **Accessibility Improvements**: Enhanced form accessibility with proper label-input associations
* **Consistent Styling**: Standardized form field appearance across all sections:
  - Client selection and site management
  - Class type and subject configuration
  - Schedule pattern and timing controls
  - Funding and exam details
  - Agent management and project supervision

#### **Enhanced Form Validation System**

*Updated `assets/js/class-schedule-form.js` (91 lines changed)*

* **Bootstrap Validation Integration**: Implemented proper Bootstrap form validation workflow
* **Custom Day Selection Validation**: Enhanced day checkbox validation with dynamic required attribute management
* **Validation Feedback Control**: Added `showDaySelectionValidationFeedback()` function for proper error display timing
* **Form Submission Handling**: Improved form submission process with:
  - Bootstrap `was-validated` class integration
  - Custom validation layered on top of native HTML5 validation
  - Proper validation feedback timing and display

#### **Schedule Day Selection Improvements**

*Enhanced day selection validation logic*

* **Dynamic Required Attributes**: First checkbox gets `required` attribute when no days selected
* **Custom Validity Messages**: Proper error messages for day selection validation
* **Validation State Management**: Improved handling of validation states during user interaction
* **Bootstrap Compatibility**: Ensured day selection validation works seamlessly with Bootstrap validation

#### **Minor UI Enhancements**

*Updated `app/Views/components/class-capture-partials/create-class.php` (2 lines changed)*

* **Consistency Fix**: Added `required` attribute to Monday checkbox in create form for validation consistency

---

## 3. Quality Assurance / Testing

* ✅ **Form Validation**: Bootstrap validation properly integrated with custom validation logic
* ✅ **User Experience**: Form validation only triggers on submission, not during user interaction
* ✅ **Accessibility**: Standard form labels improve screen reader compatibility
* ✅ **Cross-Form Consistency**: Both create and update forms now use consistent validation approach
* ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper validation feedback timing prevents premature error display
* ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved during layout conversion

## 4. Technical Improvements

### **Form Architecture**
- Standardized form layout structure across all class management forms
- Improved form validation workflow with proper Bootstrap integration
- Enhanced accessibility through standard label positioning

### **JavaScript Enhancements**
- Refined validation logic for better user experience
- Improved error handling and feedback display timing
- Better integration between custom validation and Bootstrap validation

### **Code Quality**
- Consistent code structure across form components
- Improved maintainability through standardized patterns
- Enhanced readability with proper function separation

---

## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Testing Required**: Manual testing recommended to verify form validation behavior across different browsers
* **User Experience**: New validation approach should provide smoother user interaction without premature error display
* **Future Enhancement**: Consider implementing real-time validation for specific fields where beneficial to user experience

---

## 6. Next Steps

* Manual testing of form validation across different scenarios
* Verification of accessibility improvements with screen readers
* Performance testing of enhanced validation logic
* Documentation updates for new form validation patterns
