## 2. Detailed Changes

### Major Codebase Simplification (`4aadcf2`)

> **Scope:** 113 insertions, 771 deletions across 4 files

#### **Backend Refactoring - ClassController.php**

*Updated `app/Controllers/ClassController.php` (107 additions, 466 deletions)*

**Removed Legacy Format Support:**
* Eliminated `detectScheduleDataFormat()` function
* Removed `convertLegacyToV2()` conversion logic
* Deleted `isLegacyScheduleArray()` detection method
* Removed `extractCommonTimes()` and `extractDaysFromLegacyData()` helper functions
* Eliminated `getMostCommonValue()` utility function

**Simplified Event Generation:**
* Streamlined `generateEventsFromScheduleData()` to handle V2.0 format only
* Enhanced `generateEventsFromV2Pattern()` to support both pattern-based and direct schedule entries
* Removed `generateEventsFromLegacyData()` function
* Added support for numbered keys schedule data format (e.g., '0', '1', '2')
* Improved calendar event generation with proper duration calculations

**Removed Backward Compatibility:**
* Deleted `ensureScheduleDataCompatibility()` function
* Removed migration utilities and integrity check functions
* Eliminated `createMigrator()` and `migrateAllScheduleData()` methods
* Removed `checkScheduleDataIntegrity()` comprehensive analysis function

#### **Frontend JavaScript Cleanup - class-schedule-form.js**

*Updated `assets/js/class-schedule-form.js` (5 additions, 255 deletions)*

**Legacy Format Processing Removal:**
* Deleted `processLegacyScheduleData()` function
* Removed `detectScheduleDataFormat()` detection logic
* Eliminated `convertLegacyV1Format()` conversion function
* Removed `convertFormValuesFormat()` and `convertUnknownLegacyFormat()` functions

**Backward Compatibility Cleanup:**

## 3. Quality Assurance / Testing

* ✅ **Code Simplification:** Removed 771 lines of legacy code while maintaining functionality
* ✅ **Format Standardization:** All schedule data processing now uses V2.0 format exclusively
* ✅ **Calendar Functionality:** Enhanced event generation supports both pattern-based and direct entries
* ✅ **Error Handling:** Maintained robust error handling in simplified codebase
* ✅ **Performance Improvement:** Eliminated format detection overhead and conversion processing
* ✅ **Maintainability:** Significantly reduced code complexity and potential bug sources

## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Breaking Change:** This is a significant breaking change that removes all backward compatibility with V1 format data
* **Data Migration:** Any remaining V1 format data in the database will need to be manually converted or recreated
* **Code Simplification:** The removal of 771 lines of legacy code significantly improves maintainability and reduces potential bug sources
* **Calendar Enhancement:** New support for numbered keys schedule data format improves calendar event generation reliability
