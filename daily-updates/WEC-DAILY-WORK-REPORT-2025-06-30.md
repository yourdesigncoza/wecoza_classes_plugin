## 2. Detailed Changes

### Major Feature Implementation & Bug Fixes (`c801afa`)

> **Scope:** 451 insertions, 63 deletions across 6 files

#### **Critical Bug Resolution - AJAX Form Processing**

*Fixed `app/Controllers/ClassController.php` (362 line changes)*

* **JSON Field Processing Error:** Resolved fatal error `json_decode(): Argument #1 ($json) must be of type string, array given`
* **New Method:** Added `reconstructScheduleData()` for complex form array structures
* **Field Mapping Corrections:** Fixed `schedule_start_date` → `original_start_date`, `seta_id` → `seta`
* **Enhanced Error Handling:** Comprehensive error logging throughout form processing
* **Security Improvements:** Enhanced nonce verification and validation

#### **New Feature - Automatic Redirect System**

*Enhanced `assets/js/class-capture.js` (62 line changes)*

* **Seamless UX:** Automatic redirect to single class display page after successful creation
* **WordPress Integration:** Server-generated redirect URL using `get_page_by_path()`, `get_permalink()`, `add_query_arg()`
* **Enhanced AJAX Response:** Server returns `redirect_url` in success response
* **Fallback Logic:** Graceful handling when redirect URL unavailable

#### **Database Schema Enhancement**

*Updated `app/Models/ClassModel.php` and new migration file*

* **Exam Learners Field:** Added dedicated `exam_learners` database field for better data separation
* **Migration Script:** Created `includes/migrations/add_exam_learners_field.sql` with JSONB support
* **Model Updates:** Enhanced save() and update() methods to include exam_learners
* **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained support for existing data structures

#### **Documentation & Implementation Guide**

*Created `docs/redirect-implementation.md` (49 lines)*

* **Technical Documentation:** Comprehensive guide for redirect implementation
* **Code Examples:** Backend and frontend implementation details
* **Testing Instructions:** Step-by-step verification process
* **Error Handling:** Documentation of fallback scenarios

### Configuration & Debugging Tools (`85ecd40`)

> **Scope:** 311 insertions, 12 deletions across 7 files

#### **Debug Infrastructure**

*Created comprehensive debugging toolkit*

* **Conversation Tracking:** `.compacted` summary file for session continuity
* **Form Submission Debugging:** `captured.csv` and `console.txt` for AJAX troubleshooting
* **Enhanced Logging:** Improved `DatabaseService.php` error reporting
* **Form Structure Updates:** Enhanced `create-class.php` for better debugging

#### **Development Environment Improvements**

*Updated configuration and documentation*

* **CLAUDE.md Enhancement:** Added development guidelines and workflow improvements
* **Git Configuration:** Updated `.gitignore` for debug file management
* **Repository Organization:** Improved file structure for debugging capabilities
