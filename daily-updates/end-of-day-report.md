## 2. Detailed Changes

### Major Feature Implementation (`03018e2`)

> **Scope:** 226 insertions, 515 deletions across 14 files

#### **New Feature – Learner Level Management System**

*Created `assets/js/learner-level-utils.js` (100 lines)*

* 50 + learner-level types (COMM, NUM, CL4, NL4, NS4, `BA2LP1-10`, `BA3LP1-11`, `BA4LP1-7`, WALK, HEXA, RUN, IPC, EQ, TM, SS, EEP)
* Utility functions for HTML generation & dynamic form management
* Well-documented with **JSDoc** annotations

#### **Enhanced Auto-Population Functionality**

*Updated `assets/js/class-types.js`*

* Added `classes_populate_learner_levels()` for intelligent auto-population
* Automatic learner-level selection based on class subject
* Improved error handling & debugging

#### **Improved Class-Schedule Form Integration**

*Enhanced `assets/js/class-schedule-form.js`*

* Integrated new learner-level utilities
* Updated default learner-status options: **CIC**, **RBE**, **DRO**
* Intelligent timing for auto-population after learners are added
* Removed debug console logs

#### **Backend Integration & Dependencies**

*Updated `app/Controllers/ClassController.php`*

* Added script dependencies for `learner-level-utils.js`
* Corrected loading order (utilities load first)
* **Performance:** commented-out FullCalendar CSS for potential gains

#### **Code-Quality & Documentation Cleanup**

Removed outdated docs:

* `docs/schedule-data-format-design.md` (-169 lines)
* `mini-wec-101-class-schedule-rework.md` (-66 lines)
* `tasks-mini-wec-101-class-schedule-rework.md` (-58 lines)
* `test-page-content.md` (-182 lines)

Additional:

* Updated `.gitignore`
* Minor view/model tweaks for consistency

### Repository Maintenance (`e0fc057`)

* Deleted development-workflow directory (`@wecoza-dev-flow`)
* Removed six temporary docs (-537 lines)
* Streamlined repo for production readiness

---

## 3. Quality Assurance / Testing

* ✅ **Code Quality:** `learner-level-utils.js` fully JSDoc-documented
* ✅ **Error Handling:** Robust logging in auto-population functions
* ✅ **Integration Testing:** DOM-ready timing delays verified
* ✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Existing data structures retained
* ✅ **Script Dependencies:** Correctly managed in `ClassController`
* ✅ **Repository Status:** All changes pushed & synchronized

---

## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Development Workflow:** Removal of workflow directory means new reporting processes may need to be established.
* **Feature Scope:** Today’s work substantially enhances the learner-management system, extending yesterday’s schedule-rework foundation.
