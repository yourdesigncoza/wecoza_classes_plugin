## 3. Critical Issues Resolved (`41153c0`)

### **1. Hours Calculation Discrepancy**
**Problem**: System was showing incorrect total hours (127.0 instead of expected value from class_duration field)

**Root Cause**: JavaScript was using hard-coded values instead of actual class_duration input

**Solution**: 
- Modified `getClassTypeHours()` in `assets/js/class-schedule-form.js` to read from #class_duration field
- Created `calculateActualMonths()` function for accurate calendar-based calculations
- Fixed PHP calculation in `app/Views/components/single-class-display.view.php` to stop at target sessions
- Added session limiting logic with proper break statements

### **2. Schedule End Date Not Saving**
**Problem**: Calculated schedule_end_date was not being persisted to database

**Root Cause**: End date was being lost during form data processing

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `reconstructScheduleData()` in `app/Controllers/ClassController.php` to capture end_date from multiple sources
- Added comprehensive logging to track data flow
- Implemented fallback checks for schedule_end_date, schedule_data.end_date, and schedule_data.endDate
- Verified JSONB storage in PostgreSQL schedule_data column

### **3. Boolean Field Database Error**
**Problem**: PostgreSQL error "invalid input syntax for type boolean: "")" when saving classes

**Root Cause**: Empty form values were being sent as empty strings instead of boolean values

**Solution**:
- Updated `processFormData()` to convert empty strings to false for seta_funded and exam_class
- Modified model getters `getSetaFunded()` and `getExamClass()` to ensure boolean return values
- Changed database query parameters to use PostgreSQL boolean literals ('true'/'false')
- Added debug logging for boolean field processing

### **Technical Synchronization Improvements**
- Synchronized JavaScript and PHP calculations for consistent results
- Implemented proper boolean type handling for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Added extensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Ensured schedule_end_date persistence across the entire data flow
