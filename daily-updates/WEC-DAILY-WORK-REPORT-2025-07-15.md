* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved validation and data consistency checks

#### **PHP Controller Improvements**

*Updated `app/Controllers/ClassController.php`*

* **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed file upload logic (`empty()` vs `!isset()`) that prevented additional QA visits from saving files
* **Data Structure Simplification**: Updated `handleQAReportUploads()` to work with visit objects instead of parallel arrays
* **Streamlined Data Retrieval**: Modified `getQAVisitsForClass()` to return complete visit objects directly
* **Improved File Handling**: Enhanced document processing for multiple visit uploads
