## 2. Detailed Changes

### Major Bug Fix – Per-Day Times Population (`d657c2f`)

> **Scope:** 1,716 insertions, 98 deletions across 14 files

#### **Root Cause Analysis**

*Problem:* Per-day time fields showing "Select" instead of saved values (e.g., Tuesday 6:00-6:30, Wednesday 6:00-7:00)

*Identified Issues:*
* Database contained corrupt numeric keys ("0", "1", "2") mixed with valid day names
* Format mismatch: JavaScript expected `camelCase` but database stored `snake_case`
* Data normalization happening too late in the processing pipeline

#### **Solution Implementation**

*Enhanced `update-class.php` with comprehensive data normalization:*

* **Data Validation:** Added filtering for valid day names (Monday-Sunday only)
* **Format Conversion:** Snake_case (`start_time`, `end_time`) to camelCase (`startTime`, `endTime`)
* **Corruption Cleanup:** Removed invalid numeric keys from perDayTimes object
* **Processing Order:** Moved normalization to occur before JavaScript data passing

#### **Debug Infrastructure**

*Created extensive debugging capabilities:*

* `tasks/2025-01-03-fix-per-day-times.md` - Task planning and tracking
* `tasks/2025-01-03-fix-per-day-times-complete.md` - Complete solution documentation
* `console.txt` - Console output analysis
* `captured.json` - Database structure analysis
* Enhanced debug logging throughout data flow

### UI Enhancement – Class Subject Integration (`3642944`)

> **Scope:** 612 insertions, 359 deletions across 2 files

#### **Table Structure Improvements**

*Updated `update-class.php`:*
* Added Class Subject row to Basic Information table
* Implemented responsive 2-column layout using Bootstrap grid
* Enhanced visual hierarchy and information organization

*Enhanced `single-class-display.view.php`:*
* Added Class Type and Class Subject display rows
* Rebalanced column distribution for better visual presentation
* Moved agent-related information to right column for consistency

#### **Data Display Consistency**

* Standardized field presentation across both update and display views
* Improved information accessibility and user experience
* Maintained responsive design principles

### Form Cleanup (`f78faa3`)

* Removed redundant editable `class_subject` field from update form
* Added `class_subject` as hidden field to preserve form data
* Eliminated duplicate information display

### Debug Enhancement (`5be0044`)

* Converted HTML comment debug output to JavaScript console.log
* Improved debugging experience with `?debug=1` parameter
* Enhanced visibility of data flow for troubleshooting
