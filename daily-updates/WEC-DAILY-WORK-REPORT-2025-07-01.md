## 4. Technical Achievements

### Problem Solved: JavaScript Syntax Errors
* **Issue:** AJAX responses contained PHP warnings causing "Unexpected token" errors
* **Solution:** Implemented output buffering and custom error handlers
* **Result:** Form submissions now work reliably with clean JSON responses

### UX Improvement: User Autonomy
* **Issue:** Forms pre-populated data based on assumptions
* **Solution:** Removed all automatic field population
* **Result:** Users have complete control over their input choices

### Code Quality: Debug Cleanup
* **Issue:** Development debug statements left in production code
* **Solution:** Systematic removal of console.log and debug HTML elements
* **Result:** Clean, production-ready codebase

## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Testing Required:** Form submission should be tested in production environment to ensure all edge cases are handled
* **User Training:** Since pre-populated data is removed, users may need guidance on form completion
* **Performance Impact:** Enhanced error handling adds minimal overhead but improves reliability

**Next Steps:** Consider adding form tooltips or help text to guide users through the now-blank form fields.
