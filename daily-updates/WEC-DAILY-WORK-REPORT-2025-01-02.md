**Developer**: John @ YourDesign.co.za

## Summary
Implemented Phase 1 of missing fields display functionality for the classes detail page, focusing on critical fields that were being captured but not displayed.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Updated ClassController.php
- Added `exam_learners` to the JSONB fields parsing list
- Enhanced `getSingleClass` method to enrich class data with:
  - Agent names (current, initial, and backup agents)
  - Supervisor names
  - Proper JSONB field parsing for all fields
- Added comprehensive sample test data for development testing

### 2. Added QA Reports Section
- Created new card section in `single-class-display.view.php`
- Displays QA report list with:
  - Report dates
  - Report types
  - File names with PDF icons
  - Uploader information
  - Download buttons
- Only shows when QA reports data exists
- Includes badge count of total reports

### 3. Added Exam Learners Display
- Integrated within existing Learners section
- Only displays for exam classes (`exam_class = true`)
- Shows:
  - Total exam candidates count badge
  - First 3 exam learners with status
  - Indication of additional learners if > 3
  - Exam status badges for each learner
- Visually differentiated with warning colors
