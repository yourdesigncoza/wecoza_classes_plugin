## Class Notes Form Simplification & Empty State Fixes (2025-07-11)

### Major Bug Fixes:

1. **app/Views/components/class-capture-partials/update-class.php**
   - Simplified class note form by removing title/tags fields (reduced complexity)
   - Removed `style="display: none;"` from `.notes-controls` container
   - Fixed empty state display to always show interface elements
   - Maintained proper HTML structure for notes container targeting

2. **assets/js/class-capture.js**
   - Fixed duplicate `refreshNotesDisplay()` functions causing container targeting conflicts
   - Removed problematic `addClass('d-none')` calls that were hiding empty states
   - Centralized empty state logic through single `refreshNotesDisplay()` function
   - Fixed form submission errors by updating field validation logic
   - Enhanced delete functionality with proper `class_id` parameter handling
   - Improved initialization order to prevent timing conflicts
   - Added safety net with setTimeout for proper display state

3. **app/Controllers/ClassController.php**
   - Updated `saveClassNote()` method to handle simplified form structure
   - Fixed `deleteClassNote()` method with comprehensive debug logging
   - Updated field validation to remove title/tags requirements
   - Enhanced error handling and response consistency

### Issues Resolved:

- **Empty State Display**: Fixed notes container showing blank instead of "Add Note" interface
- **Duplicate Functions**: Removed conflicting `refreshNotesDisplay()` targeting wrong containers
- **Form Submission**: Fixed JSON parsing errors due to undefined title field
- **Delete Functionality**: Added missing `class_id` parameter for note deletion
- **Interface Visibility**: Always show search/filter/add controls even when no notes exist
- **Initialization Conflicts**: Resolved timing issues between different initialization functions

### Key Technical Improvements:

- **Consistent State Management**: All empty state logic now flows through `refreshNotesDisplay()`
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate function definitions
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved AJAX error states and user feedback
- **Enhanced UX**: Users can always access "Add Note" functionality regardless of state
