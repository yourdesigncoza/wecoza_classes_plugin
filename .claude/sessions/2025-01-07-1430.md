### Key Accomplishments
1. **Session Infrastructure Setup**
   - Created `.claude/sessions/` directory structure
   - Implemented session tracking system with `.current-session` file
   - Established standardized session documentation format

2. **Development Workflow Enhancement**
   - Added `/session-start` and `/session-end` command support
   - Created framework for tracking development sessions
   - Prepared infrastructure for future session management

### Features Implemented
- Session file creation with standardized format
- Active session tracking mechanism
- Session documentation structure

### Problems Encountered and Solutions
- **Issue:** `.current-session` file didn't exist initially
- **Solution:** Created empty file first, then wrote content to establish tracking

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings
- No breaking changes introduced
- Session infrastructure is purely additive

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- No dependencies modified

### Configuration Changes
- Added `.claude/sessions/` directory structure
- Created session tracking file `.claude/sessions/.current-session`

### Deployment Steps Taken
- No deployment steps required (infrastructure setup only)

### Lessons Learned
- Session tracking requires both directory structure and tracking file
- Empty files need to be read before writing to avoid errors
- Session documentation should be comprehensive for future reference

### What Wasn't Completed
- No user goals were set (session ended before goal definition)
- No actual development work beyond infrastructure setup

### Tips for Future Developers
- Use `/session-start` at beginning of development sessions
- Always define clear goals when starting sessions
- Use `/session-update` to track progress during development
- Session files provide valuable context for understanding development history
- The `.current-session` file tracks which session is active for proper session management
