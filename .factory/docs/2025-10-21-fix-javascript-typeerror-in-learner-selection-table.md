# Fix JavaScript Errors in Learner Selection Table

## Problem Analysis
The main errors are `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'checked')` in `learner-selection-table.js` at lines 380 and 386. These occur when the `updateSelectAllCheckbox()` method tries to access properties of a DOM element that doesn't exist.

## Root Cause
The `updateSelectAllCheckbox()` method retrieves the "select all" checkbox element but doesn't validate that it exists before trying to set its properties (`checked` and `indeterminate`).

## Solution Plan

### 1. Fix the updateSelectAllCheckbox Method
- Add null checks before accessing `selectAllCheckbox` properties
- Ensure the method handles missing DOM elements gracefully
- This will fix the primary errors at lines 380 and 386

### 2. Improve Error Resilience
- Add defensive programming practices throughout the class
- Check for DOM element existence before manipulation
- Add proper error handling for edge cases

### 3. Test the Fix
- Verify the learner selection table works correctly on update class pages
- Ensure all checkbox functionality (select all, individual selection) works
- Confirm no console errors occur during normal operation

## Files to Modify
- `assets/js/learner-selection-table.js` - Fix null reference errors in updateSelectAllCheckbox method

## Expected Outcome
- No more `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null` errors
- Learner selection table functionality remains intact
- Better error handling for missing DOM elements
