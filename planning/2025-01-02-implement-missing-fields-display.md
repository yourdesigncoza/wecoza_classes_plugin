**Created**: 2025-01-02
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

  - [x] Add proper null/empty state handling
  - [x] Test with sample QA report data

- [x] **Implement Exam Learners Display**

  - [x] Add conditional section within Learners area (only show if `exam_class = true`)
  - [x] Create exam candidates list with status badges
  - [x] Differentiate exam learners from regular learners visually
  - [x] Test with exam and non-exam classes

### Phase 2: Important Fields (Priority: HIGH) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Implement Class Notes Timeline**
  - [x] Parse `class_notes_data` JSONB in controller
  - [x] Create new collapsible card section for notes
  - [x] Implement timeline UI with timestamps and authors
  - [x] Add note categories/types if available
  - [x] Handle empty state gracefully

- [x] **Add Stop/Restart Periods Summary**
  - [x] Parse `stop_restart_dates` JSONB array
  - [x] Add summary row to schedule information section
  - [x] Calculate and display duration for each stop period
  - [x] Show stop/restart date pairs clearly
  - [x] Include reasons if available in data

- [x] **Display Backup Agents List**
  - [x] Parse `backup_agent_ids` JSONB array
  - [x] Fetch agent names from database using IDs
  - [x] Add backup agents row after primary agent
  - [x] Show agent names with contact info if available
  - [x] Handle empty backup agents gracefully

### Phase 3: Optional Enhancement (Priority: LOW) ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Add Initial Agent History**
  - [x] Include `initial_class_agent` and `initial_agent_start_date` fields
  - [x] Fetch initial agent name from database
  - [x] Only display if different from current agent
  - [x] Add below current agent with history icon
  - [x] Format dates consistently

### Additional Tasks

- [x] **Update ClassController Methods** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Modify `getSingleClass()` to include all missing fields
  - [x] Add proper JSONB parsing for all fields
  - [x] Include agent name lookups for backup and initial agents
  - [x] Add error handling for malformed JSON data


## Subtasks

### Controller Updates Subtasks
- [ ] Add JSONB parsing helper methods
- [ ] Implement agent name lookup queries
- [ ] Add data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Update method documentation

### UI Implementation Subtasks
- [ ] Create reusable UI components for repeated patterns
- [ ] Implement loading states for async data
- [ ] Add error boundaries for failed data loads
- [ ] Create consistent empty state messages


## Technical Notes

1. All JSONB fields must be properly decoded in PHP before use
2. Use Bootstrap 5 components to match existing UI
3. Maintain consistent icon usage from Bootstrap Icons
4. Follow existing code patterns for data display
5. Ensure all text is properly escaped for security

## Completion Criteria

- All 6 missing fields are displayed on the detail page
- Proper error handling for missing/malformed data
- Responsive design works on all devices
- No performance degradation with large datasets
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
