/**
 * Single Class Display - Schedule Statistics Component
 *
 * NOTE: This is a placeholder file. The Schedule Statistics display section
 * (lines 1307-1398 in single-class-display.view.php) depends on the
 * $monthly_data variable calculated in the Monthly Schedule Summary section.
 *
 * The section displays:
 * - Year-grouped monthly cards
 * - Total hours per month
 * - Exception count badges
 * - Stop/Start period badges
 * - Expandable calculation breakdowns per month
 * - Detailed session accounting (potential, removals, additions)
 *
 * This component will be extracted separately once the schedule-monthly.php
 * component is refactored and the $monthly_data calculation is moved
 * to an appropriate service class.
 *
 * @package WeCoza
 * @subpackage Views/Components/SingleClass
 * @todo Extract this component after schedule-monthly.php refactoring
 *
 * Required Variables (when implemented):
 *   - $monthly_data: Pre-calculated monthly statistics array from service

// This component is not yet implemented
// The schedule statistics display is still rendered inline in single-class-display.view.php
// See lines 1307-1398 for the current implementation
