/**
 * Single Class Display - Monthly Schedule Summary Component
 *
 * NOTE: This is a placeholder file. The Monthly Schedule Summary section
 * (lines 991-1306 in single-class-display.view.php) contains complex PHP
 * helper functions and calculation logic that needs to be refactored
 * before extraction to a component.
 *
 * The section includes:
 * - Monthly schedule data processing with DateInterval calculations
 * - Holiday detection using PublicHolidaysController
 * - Session counting with pattern matching (weekly, biweekly, monthly)
 * - Exception dates, stop/restart periods handling
 * - Holiday override additions
 * - Calculation breakdown storage for UI display
 *
 * This component will be extracted separately once the helper functions
 * are moved to an appropriate service class.
 *
 * @package WeCoza
 * @subpackage Views/Components/SingleClass
 * @todo Extract this component after refactoring helper functions to a service
 *
 * Required Variables (when implemented):
 *   - $class: Array of class data from the database
 *   - $schedule_data: Decoded schedule data
 *   - $monthly_data: Pre-calculated monthly statistics array

// This component is not yet implemented

// See lines 991-1398 for the current implementation
