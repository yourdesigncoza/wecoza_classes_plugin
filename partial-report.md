# End of Day Work Report - July 2, 2025

## Summary
Successfully resolved three critical issues in the WeCoza Classes Plugin affecting class creation, time calculations, and database operations. All issues have been fixed and tested, with the system now functioning correctly.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Hours Calculation Discrepancy** 
**Problem**: System was showing incorrect total hours (127.0 instead of expected value from class_duration field)
**Root Cause**: JavaScript was using hard-coded values instead of actual class_duration input
**Solution**: 
- Modified `getClassTypeHours()` in class-schedule-form.js to read from #class_duration field
- Created `calculateActualMonths()` function for accurate calendar-based calculations
- Fixed PHP calculation in single-class-display.view.php to stop at target sessions
- Added session limiting logic with proper break statements

### 2. **Schedule End Date Not Saving**
**Problem**: Calculated schedule_end_date was not being persisted to database
**Root Cause**: End date was being lost during form data processing
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `reconstructScheduleData()` in ClassController.php to capture end_date from multiple sources
- Added comprehensive logging to track data flow
- Implemented fallback checks for schedule_end_date, schedule_data.end_date, and schedule_data.endDate
- Verified JSONB storage in PostgreSQL schedule_data column

### 3. **Boolean Field Database Error**
**Problem**: PostgreSQL error "invalid input syntax for type boolean: """ when saving classes
**Root Cause**: Empty form values were being sent as empty strings instead of boolean values
**Solution**:
- Updated `processFormData()` to convert empty strings to false for seta_funded and exam_class
- Modified model getters `getSetaFunded()` and `getExamClass()` to ensure boolean return values
- Changed database query parameters to use PostgreSQL boolean literals ('true'/'false')
- Added debug logging for boolean field processing

## Files Modified

### JavaScript Files
1. `/assets/js/class-schedule-form.js`
   - Fixed getClassTypeHours() function
   - Added calculateActualMonths() function
   - Enhanced debug logging for session calculations

### PHP Files
1. `/app/Controllers/ClassController.php`
   - Enhanced processFormData() for boolean handling
   - Improved reconstructScheduleData() for end date capture
   - Added comprehensive debug logging

2. `/app/Views/components/single-class-display.view.php`
   - Fixed session calculation loop
   - Added break statement to stop at target sessions
   - Corrected stop period logic

3. `/app/Models/ClassModel.php`
   - Updated getSetaFunded() and getExamClass() to return proper booleans
   - Modified save() and update() methods to use PostgreSQL boolean literals

## Technical Details

### Key Improvements
- Synchronized JavaScript and PHP calculations for consistent results
- Implemented proper boolean type handling for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Added extensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Ensured schedule_end_date persistence across the entire data flow

### Testing Performed
- Verified hours calculation matches class_duration input
- Confirmed schedule_end_date is saved to database
- Tested boolean field submission with various values
- Validated form submission completes successfully

## Impact
These fixes ensure accurate class scheduling, proper data persistence, and reliable form submissions. The system now correctly handles various course durations, saves all schedule data, and maintains PostgreSQL compatibility.

## Next Steps
- Monitor system for any edge cases
- Consider adding automated tests for these scenarios
- Document the calculation logic for future reference
